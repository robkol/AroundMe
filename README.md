This is a first attempt at an application that loads a number of latitude longitude co-ordinates that are of interest and then uses a kd-tree to find
places of interest around a given latitude longitude.

Im using the kd-tree implemented by Justin Wetherell, http://code.google.com/p/java-algorithms-implementation/source/browse/trunk/src/com/jwetherell/algorithms/data_structures/KdTree.java?r=368 so thanks for that if you ever see this.
